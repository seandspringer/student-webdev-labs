**====================================**

### HTML

1. Outside of glancing at the table example to remember the exact tag names, I was able to complete these exercises on my own. I'm still getting used to all the <input> and <label> tag syntax so I looked at the lecture slides to remind myself which attribute gets the for and which gets the id attribute (label gets the for).
2. I found these very helpful because they utilized all of the different tags that were presented in class.
3. I'm still not 100% about how detailed to get in an images alt attribute. Should we explain the image in great detail or just provide a quick cursory explanation? Also, the example slides showed using leading phrases like "image of" prior to the detailed explanation of the image, however when I WAVE'd the page, it flagged this preceeding phrase as an error stating that it is redundant because most text readers will automatically include that language in the reading.
4. I'm interested to undertand how to handle the actions that occur after pressing an <input type="submit"> button. I see how it populates the url with the name=value components seperated by & however how does one determine where to send this information and how can we use HTML to parse these inputs?

### Accessibility

1. I completed this exercise on my own, however after reviewing the solutions I realized that I had forgotten to include the value attribute in the radio buttons!
2. These exercises were helpful in reinforcing the basics. I would have liked to understand the aria-attributes better and maybe an example would help with that. Also, using WAVE to help guide the corrections was very helpful!
3. One thing I'm still a bit unsure about is when you need to define the value attribute. In this example, the <input type=text> does not require a value because the value appears to come from the input text. However, the radio buttons require a value I guess because the <label> name tied to that button does not automatically relate. Generic rules to help remember when to use value would be helpful in my oppinion.
4. Using the aria attributes like aria-expanded and aria-haspopup in examples would be helpful because I still do not understand when to use these specific attributes.
